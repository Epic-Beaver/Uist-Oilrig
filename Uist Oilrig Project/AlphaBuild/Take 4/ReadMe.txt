Team Uist Dynamic Decommissioning README

Instructions:

- The game is built for Windows 10, checked with a 1920x1080 and 3440x1440 monitor.
- To play the game, run the "Uist Oilrig Project" executable.
- From there, the game should be self-sufficient

Known Bugs:

- In the Operation Selection menu, the first button (Planning Stage) will be highlighted and greyed out regardless of what button is pressed by the user. This does not impact gameplay, and the buttons work as intended otherwise.
- Some of the hitboxes on the Decommissioning operation are slightly larger than they seem. This should not normally impact gameplay in a negative way.
- Due to mis-placed origins, and rotations, some of the objects in the Decommissioning operation will animate in unexpected ways. This is purely visual and will be fixed in alpha.
